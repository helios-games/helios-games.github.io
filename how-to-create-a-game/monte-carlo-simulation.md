title: Monte Carlo Simulation
---
Along with normal testing, such as unit or integration, it is important to test out random behaviour in games. This can be achieved by performing montecarlo simulations. These make sure a game paysout the correct return to the player. This is typically around 97-99% for a casino game, 95-97% for a slot. A simulation may need to run upwards of 10m to 100m plays to produce an estimate that is useful.
